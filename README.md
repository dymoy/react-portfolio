## Description 

Hello, world! Welcome to my online portfolio. I've build this website to introduce myself and highlight my journey as a Full Stack Web Developer thus far.

My webpage is split into 4 major sections: About Me, Porfolio, Resume, and Contact Me. These pages present vistors with a a small summary of myself, some of my highlighted projects, my resume and skills, as well as a form to contact me. 

I've created this website using React and Vite, and hosted it on Netlify which you can access [here](https://dymoy.netlify.app/). Take a look around and send me a message if you're interested in connecting!
